# JavaScript Simon 🟥🟨🟩🟦

Test your IQ level by following a sequence. Beware: This is THE real IQ test.

Follow the tiles and prove you have a big brain (or just memory). There are no prizes, just the (dis)satisfaction that you can(not) think and remember.

## How to Play

The game starts when a random tile is flashed. You need to pick the tile that was flashed. Then the game flashes another tile. Now you have to pick the previous and the new tile in the correct order. Keep repeating the sequence adding the new tile each time. Game over if you get anything wrong.

## Applications

This game is really good

1. If you want to work your memory
2. If you have no friends and want to feel bad about yourself
3. Killing time
4. I will come up with something at number 4 later
